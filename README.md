# Personal-List
I made this list for personal use.  
It is recommended to use _Personal List_ with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) or Adguard.  
Special for uBo syntax (and Adguard) is [this list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List%20(uBo).txt)  
[This "Personal" list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List.txt) contains the following filterlists:

## *[EasyList Dutch](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/tree/main/easylistdutch)*
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch. <br>
I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.

---

### Those list were in the list
Because I want other people also use this list, they are no longer included:
#### *[My filters](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/My%20filters.txt)*
Different kind of rules  
 - Rules copied from Adguard Spyware and Adguard Spyware (Dutch)  
 - Blocking of parameters  
 - Blocking of privacy banners on Google and YouTube  
 - Some rules copied from uBlock Privacy and Unbreak  
 - Some rules regarding sites I often visit (both blocking and hiding rules) 

#### *[Nano anti-adblock](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/Nano%20anti-Adblock.txt)* 
Because the famous Nano filterlists are archieved I copied the most usefull rules in regard to anti-adblock.
