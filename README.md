# Personal-List
I made this list for personal use. 

It is recommended to use _Personal List_ with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) or Adguard. 

Special for uBo syntax (and Adguard) is [this list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List%20(uBo).txt)

[This "Persosal" list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List.txt) contains the following filterlists:

## *[EasyList Dutch](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/tree/main/easylistdutch)*
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch. 

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.

##### IMPORTANT
Because the current filterlist [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/easydutch) is now regulary updated I don't update my own list. 

If you see ads on dutch websites please report it [here](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/issues).

## *[My filters](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/My%20filters.txt)*
Different kind of rule
 - Rules copied from Adguard Spyware and Adguard Spyware (Dutch)
 - Blocking of parameters
 - Blocking of privacy banners on Google and YouTube
 - Some rules copied from uBlock Privacy and Unbreak
 - Some rules regarding sites I often visit (both blocking and hiding rules) 

## *[Nano anti-adblock](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/Nano%20anti-Adblock.txt)*
Because the famous Nano filterlists are archieved I copied the most usefull rules in regard to anti-adblock.
