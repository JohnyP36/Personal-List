# Personal-List
I made this list for personal use.  
It is recommended to use _Personal List_ with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) or Adguard.  
Special for uBo syntax (and Adguard) is [this list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List%20(uBo).txt)  
[This "Personal" list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List.txt) contains the following filterlists:

## *[EasyList Dutch](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/tree/main/easylistdutch)*
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch. <br>
I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often. <br>
**And more important: EasyList doesn't allow anti-adblock rules. *See [EasyListDutch/issue#30](https://github.com/easylist/easylistdutch/issues/30) and [EasyListDutch/pr#11issuecomment](https://github.com/easylist/easylistdutch/pull/11#issuecomment-818864565)***

---

### Those list were in the list
Because I want other people also use this list, they are **no longer included**:
#### *[My filters](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/My%20filters.txt)*
Different kind of rules  
 - Rules copied from Adguard Spyware and Adguard Spyware (Dutch)  
 - Blocking of parameters  
 - Blocking of privacy banners on Google and YouTube  
 - Some rules copied from uBlock Privacy and Unbreak  
 - Some rules regarding sites I often visit (both blocking and hiding rules) 

#### *[Nano anti-adblock](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/other%20lists/Nano%20anti-Adblock.txt)* 
Because the famous Nano filterlists are archieved I copied the most usefull rules in regard to anti-adblock.

> ### Filter lists
> 
> #### Ordening of filers 
> 
> New filter must be added on the top of each list. 
> 
> The reason is to provide an easy way to check whether a filter is still relevant. The filters at the end of the file will be the oldest filters, and also the most likely to maybe be obsolete. 
> 
> Old filters which are confirmed to still be required must be moved to the top of the list. 
> 
> **Note in addition to above: everything has to be in an *alphabetic* order!**
> 
> #### Issue number association 
> 
> **All** added filters must be associated with a formal issue number or date *(and only I have the right to break this rule)*, example:
> 
> ```
> ! https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/issues/7777 
> ||data.inertanceretinallaurel.com^  
> ! 2021-04-27  
> ||androidplanet.nl,iphoned.nl##.dynamic-content-native
> ```
> 
> This way this documents why a filter was added, and how to verify whether an old filter is still needed. The comment line preceding the filter(s) to solve a specific issue should be only a URL to the issue. The issue itself can contains all the details about how the issue was solved, and why it was solved this way, etc.
> 
> #### Commit message
> 
> Keep it simple. 
>  - Put in the title box `A:` for adding a site, `C` for changing a rule, `R` for removing a rule. Use `M` for moving a rule/rules to another part in the filterlist
>  - Put here after the site url. Example `mediamarkt.nl` ~~`https://www.mediamarkt.nl/view/`~~. 
>  - At the end put the issue number. 
> 
> So `A: mediamarkt.nl fix #7`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
> 
> ##### How to know in which lists the rule(s) belong? 
> 
> - Block (general)      = *Algemene geblokkeerde netwerkfilters*
> - Block 1p (server)    = *Advertentiedomeinen (die op server niveau geblokkeerd worden)*
> - Block 3p (server)    = *Advertentiedomeinen (die als 3e partij geblokkeerd worden)*
> - Block 1p (specific)  = *Specifieke Netwerkfilters / Advertentiedomeinen (die op server niveau geblokkeerd worden)*
> - Block 3p (specific)  = *Specifieke Advertentiedomeinen (die als 3e partij geblokkeerd worden)*
> - Block 1p (whitelist) = *Uitzonderingen netwerkfilters 1e partij*
> - Block 3p (whitelist) = *Uitzonderingen netwerkfilters 3e partij*
> - Hide (general)       = *Algemene verbergregels*
> - Hide (specific)      = *Specifieke verbergregels*
> - Hide (whitelist)     = *Uitzonderingen verbergregels*
> - Anti-Adblock         = *Anti-AdBlock*
