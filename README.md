# Personal-List
I made this list for personal use. 
[This "Persosal" list](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Personal%20List.txt) contains the following filterlists:

## [EasyList Dutch](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/tree/main/easylistdutch)
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.

##### IMPORTANT
Because the current filterlist [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/easydutch) is now regulary updated I don't update my own list. 
If you see ads on dutch websites please report it [here](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/issues).

## [Adguard Spyware (Dutch)](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Adguard%20Spyware%20%5BDutch%5D.txt)
Rules copied from Adguard Spyware and Adguard Spyware [Dutch]. 
##### IMPORTANT
See the **important** note above!

## [Nano anti-adblock](https://github.com/JohnyP36/Personal-List/blob/main/Nano%20anti-Adblock.txt)
Because the famous Nano filterlist are archieved I copied the most usefull rules in regard to anti-adblock




It can recommended to use _Personal List_ with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets).
