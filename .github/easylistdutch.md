### Prerequisites
<!-- Check the appropriate boxes before you submit your issue -->

- [ ] This is a **Dutch** domain, so no general websites with Dutch subdomains (e.g. nl.y8.com)
- [ ] I performed a cursory search of the issue tracker to avoid opening a duplicate issue
    - Your issue may already be reported.
- [ ] I tried to reproduce the issue when...
    - [ ] [EasyList](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt) and [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt) are enabled
    - [ ] Other privacy related webextensions are disabled <!-- Just to ensure there is no issues or conflicts with other webbrowser extensions. -->
    - [ ] uBlock Origin with default lists/settings
    - [ ] using a new, unmodified browser profile
- [ ] I am running the latest version of uBlock Origin (or Adguard or Adblock Plus, etc.)
- [ ] This is not an `NSFW` issue. 
       - If it is, put "NSFW" in the title of your issue

### URL(s) where the issue occurs
<!-- [At least one URL for a web page where the clearly described issue occurs is **mandatory**. The backticks surrounding the URLs is important, it prevents the URL from being clickable. Warn with "NSFW" where applicable.] -->

### Describe the issue
<!-- [Be as clear as possible: nobody can read mind, and nobody is looking at your issue over your shoulder.] --> 
<!-- Just a description of the issue when you visit the site. Or steps on reproducing this  -->

### Screenshot(s)
<!-- [Screenshot(s) for difficult to describe visual issues are **mandatory**. Post links instead of **Inline Images** for Screenshots containing **Adult material**.] -->

### Versions
- Browser/version: **[here]**,*[here]*
- Extension name / version: **[here]**,*[here]*

### Notes
<!-- [Add here the result of whatever investigation work you have done: please investigate the issues you report -- this prevents burdening other volunteers. This is especially true for issues arising from settings which are very different from default ones.] -->
<!-- If you suspect certain filters (this helps spending time to debug it manually).
If you have a screenshot of the issue or advert, this will help to highlight it. -->
