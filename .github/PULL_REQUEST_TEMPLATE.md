### Prerequisites
<!-- Check the appropriate boxes before you submit your issue -->

- [ ] This is a **Dutch** domain *(also general websites with Dutch subdomains (e.g. nl.y8.com))*
- [ ] I performed a cursory search of the issue tracker to avoid opening a duplicate issue or pull request
    - Your issue may already be reported or someone else already started a pull request.
- [ ] This is more than **one** issue 
    - Otherwise open a new issue
- [ ] I tried to reproduce the issue when...
    - [ ] [EasyList](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt) and [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt) are enabled
    - [ ] Other privacy related webextensions are disabled <!-- Just to ensure there is no issues or conflicts with other webbrowser extensions. -->
    - [ ] uBlock Origin with default lists/settings
    - [ ] using a new, unmodified browser profile
- [ ] I am running the latest version of uBlock Origin (or Adguard or Adblock Plus, etc.)

### URL(s) where the issue occurs
[At least one URL for a web page where the clearly described issue occurs is **mandatory**. The backticks (`) surrounding the URLs is important, it prevents the URL from being clickable. Warn with "NSFW" where applicable.]

### Describe the issue
<!-- [Be as clear as possible: nobody can read mind, and nobody is looking at your issue over your shoulder.]  
[Just a description of the issues when you visit the sites. Or steps on reproducing this] -->

### Screenshot(s)
<!-- [Screenshot(s) for difficult to describe visual issues are **mandatory**. Post links instead of **Inline Images** for Screenshots containing **Adult material**.] -->
<!-- [Replace `![image](%screenshot_url%)` below with a link to the screenshot of the problem. Also, you can paste image from clipboard instead. It will be automatically loaded.  
If you have multiple screenshots just copy-paste the 3 line below. Please remove the `x` after screenshot with a number if you uploaded a screenshot.] -->

### Notes
[Add here the result of whatever investigation work you have done: please investigate the issues you report -- this prevents burdening other volunteers. This is especially true for issues arising from settings which are very different from default ones. 
If you suspect certain filters (this helps spending time to debug it manually).
If you have a screenshot of the issue or advert, this will help to highlight it.]
